# Amazon S3
- object based storage



## S3 event notifications
- trigger an action (lambda) on api request to the bucket
- read-after-write consistency
## S3 Access Logs
- monitor traffic requests to an S3 bucket
- can be used for access and security audits
- understand s3 bill

## MFA-protected API Access
- enforce MFA for access to S3 ressources
## MFA delte
- enforce MFA for delte object action
## Versioning
- if an object is updated the old version still persists within the bucket
- if an object is deleted the new version will be a delete marker, and the old version will still persist within the bucket
## Commands 
### S3 Sync
- copies objects between buckets
- does diff
- used last modified to update
- if versioned only copies current version
```bash
aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET
```
## Storage Tiers
- can transition first after 30 days
### Glacier
- cannot be directly inserted only transfered from default tier
- low cost but higher retrieval cost and time

### Infreqnet Access
- less freq access, but instantly available
- low per GB Storage price
- retrival fee
### One Zone / One Zone IA
- single AZ storage 20% less cost

## Tranfer Accelerator
- fast transfer over long distances
- uses cloudfront edge locations
- routes via optimized path

## Multipard uploaads
- transmit object in chuncks
- if one chunk fails, only that cuck needs to be retransmitted
- over 100mb should be considered
-  improved throughput

## S3 Bucket Policies
- add or deny permissions to objects
- can be attached to users groups or buckets
- can grant access to other aws accounts
- can restrict based on multi coditions for the requets (ip, time, ssl )

## ACL
- can also use ACL to grant another account access

## Encryption

### SEE S3
- Server Side encryption of objects 
- aws manged
- replication by default
### SEE C
- Server Side encryption
- customer managed keys
- obhects can not be replicated

### SSE KMS
- Need to specify need key for object in new bucket
- need iam role to decrypt with source key and encrypt with new key
- might get kms throttling errors, need to ask for service quotas increase
- can use multi region kms keys
